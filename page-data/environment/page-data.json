Will envelopes come in two sizes – letter and legal. They can be personalized to include your name and address and even your business logo. The legal stationery supplier will charge you extra for personalized printing depending upon the matter printed on the envelopes. More the information that you wish to put on the envelopes, higher is the price that you have to pay. Choice of a font other than the regularly used gothic font will also mean higher charges.   When you order for will covers in bulk, the suppliers usually ship them to you promptly unless you have placed a personalized order which may require anywhere up to 2 weeks to reach you. You can also look for legal stationery suppliers who will send you a larger quantity of supplies based on your order. For example, an order placed for 200 covers may fetch you 250 covers at the same price. Any order which is for less than 100 covers may be priced as per rates for dozen pieces.  Most stationery material suppliers also have a good stock of legal stationery.
